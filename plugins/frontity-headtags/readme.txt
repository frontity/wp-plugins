Adds all the meta tags of the head section to WordPress REST API responses, including the ones generated by SEO plugins like Yoast or All in One SEO. Made by [Frontity](https://frontity.org?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=rest-api-head-tags-plugin).

== Description ==

This plugin adds all the tags in the head section of a website to WordPress REST API responses.

It is perfect if you are using WordPress for a headless set-up and would like to add the **meta tags** generated by your **WordPress SEO plugin** (like Yoast SEO or All-in-One SEO Pack) to the WordPress REST API output.

#### Requirements 

This package depends on the [PHP DOM library](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php). Most PHP environments have it by default so you don't have to worry about that.

> In case you get some errors regarding this dependency make sure you have this library installed (you can take a look at this [thread](https://github.com/frontity/wp-plugins/issues/35) in the code repository).

#### Compatibility

This plugin is compatible and works out of the box with some of the most popular WordPress SEO plugins. These are the ones that we tested:

  * **[Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)** (up to 13.5)
  * **[All in One SEO Pack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/)** (up to 3.4.2)
  * **[WP SEO](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wp-seo)**

Are you using a different SEO plugin and want to know if it's compatible? Feel free to ask in our [community forum](https://community.frontity.org/?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=rest-api-head-tags-plugin). If you tested any other plugin, please let us know as well so we can update the list.

== How to use this plugin ==

#### Entities with head tags

The plugin has been developed to include the head_tags field to the REST API response of most of the WordPress core entities:

  * Posts, pages, attachments and custom post types.
  * Post types: for archive pages.
  * Categories, tags and custom taxonomies.
  * Authors.

#### In a Frontity project

If you are using [Frontity](https://frontity.org?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=rest-api-head-tags-plugin), you just have to install the [@frontity/head-tags package](https://docs.frontity.org/api-reference-1/frontity-head-tags?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=rest-api-head-tags-plugin) and **it will work automatically**.

#### In a different project

You need to understand better how it works and **add the data manually**.

***How to fetch the head_tags field manually***

You have to get each entity from its respective REST API endpoint. For example: for fetching the posts, you should go to `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts&id=123` endpoint; for fetching the categories, you have to go to `wp-json/wp/v2/categories&id=123`, and for custom post types or custom taxonomies, it would be a different url in each case.

In the case of the homepage, it's less intuitive and you should go to `/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post`. As previously said, each entity has a different endpoint so if you aren't familiar with this, you should check out the [WordPress REST API reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/) for more information.

Inside each endpoint, it will be a new field named *head_tags*, which will be an array of objects representing the tags that WordPress would normally include inside the html head element. These objects have the properties `tag`, `attributes` and `content`.

For example for these HTML tags:

`
<title>Hello wordl! - My Site</title>
<meta name="robots" content="max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1">
<link rel="canonical" href="<http://mysite.com/hello-world/>" />
`

This would be the content of the head_tags field:

`
"head_tags": [
  {
    "tag": "title",
    "content": "Hello world! - My Site"
  },
  {
    "tag": "meta",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "robots",
      "content": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1"
    }
  },
  {
    "tag": "link",
    "attributes": {
      "rel": "canonical",
      "href": "<http://mysite.com/hello-world/>"
    }
  }
]
`

== Settings ==

The settings of this plugin are really simple.

#### Purge cache

In order to not affect the performance of your site, the head_tags field is cached for all your responses. Each time you update a post/page/cpt or a taxonomy, the cache for that entity will be purged automatically. In case you make global changes (i.e. your permalinks or your global Yoast settings) use the Purge button to clean the whole cache.

#### Enable output

By default, the head_tags field is included in the common endpoint of each entity. You can configure it so it doesn't appear by default and to be shown when you include the head_tags=true query.

For example, with the output disabled, `https://mysite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts` won't show the head_tags field unless you have the query `?head_tags=true` at the end.

#### Skip cache

In case you want to skip the cache, you can do so by adding to the query the  parameter `skip_cache`.

There are some cache plugins for the REST API which also use the same parameter. In case you want to ignore the cache for the REST API call but not for the head tags, you can use `skip_cache&head_tags_skip_cache=false`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the plugin only within a Frontity project? =

No, you can use it for any headless WordPress project. However, if you use Frontity, you can get all the data automatically with this [Frontity package](https://docs.frontity.orgapi-reference-1/frontity-head-tags?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=rest-api-head-tags-plugin). On the other hand, if you are not using Frontity, you have to add the data manually as explained on the [plugin's documentation](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-plugins/rest-api-head-tags#in-a-different-project).

= I have installed and activated the plugin, where can I find the tags? =

You can find the head tags exposed in the WordPress REST API after making an API request. You can find a new field named `head_tags` which is an array of all the meta tags, just as they appear in the web page <head> section. You can see more information at the [plugin docs](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-plugins/rest-api-head-tags#in-a-different-project?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=rest-api-head-tags-plugin).

= Where can I find the head tags of the homepage? =

If you are not using this [Frontity package](https://docs.frontity.org/api-reference-1/frontity-head-tags?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=rest-api-head-tags-plugin) (which will automatically add the head tags), you should fetch this data at `/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post`  endpoint.

= Will the plugin add the meta tags to my custom post types and custom taxonomies? =

Yes, the plugin will automatically add the meta tags to the custom post types and custom taxonomies. You can check which entities show the new field on [its docs](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-plugins/rest-api-head-tags#entities-with-head-tags?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=rest-api-head-tags-plugin).

= Is this plugin compatible with Yoast SEO plugin? And with All in One SEO Pack? =

Yes, it works with both Yoast SEO and All in One SEO plugins. We actually plan to make it compatible with most of the WordPress SEO plugins. If you test it with any other plugin, kindly let us know whether it works or not so we can update the list.
